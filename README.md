# TET-CVTL-Topological-Catalysis-for-Aneutronic-p--B-Fusion-and-Vacuum-Torque-Propulsion
Theoretical framework for ultra-high-Isp propulsion via TET–CVTL anyonic catalysis (θ=6π/5), p-¹¹B fusion enhancement, and propellant-free vacuum torque extraction. Includes QuTiP proxy simulations (Z=126 gold curve, 35–60× boost). TET Collective initiative.
