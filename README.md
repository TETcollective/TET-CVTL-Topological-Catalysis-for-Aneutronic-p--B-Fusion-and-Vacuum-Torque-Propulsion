# TET–CVTL: Topological Catalysis for Aneutronic p-¹¹B Fusion and Vacuum Torque Propulsion

**TET Collective Initiative** — Symon Zu (January 2026)

This repository contains the preprint, LaTeX source, QuTiP simulation code, figures, and supporting materials for the work on protonic engine concepts enabled by the TET–CVTL (Topological Entanglement Thread — Collective Vacuum Torque Lattice) framework.

## Overview

The framework uses the primordial trefoil knot (3₁) and saturations (L₆ proxy) to generate anyonic braiding phase θ = 6π/5, enabling:
- 30–60× enhancement of p-¹¹B fusion cross-sections via multi-path tunneling interference
- Continuous propellant-free thrust from asymmetric vacuum torque extraction
- Three engine concepts: Hybrid MHD + plasma nozzle (Isp 10⁴–10⁶ s), laser-plasma pulsed p-¹¹B (Isp ∼10⁵ s), pure vacuum torque (Isp → ∞)

QuTiP proxy simulations demonstrate dramatic fusion overlap boost (Z=126 "gold curve").
